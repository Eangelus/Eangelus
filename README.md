## Hi there 👋, I´m Tom!

👨‍💻 A passionate software designer.

It started with my Commodore 64 and continues to this day.
I always wanted to become a programmer, in 2021 I took the plunge and started training as an application developer. Since 2023, I have also been a programmer on paper.

When I got bored of hardware, I started learning Java in my spare time, followed by C++. 

During my training as an application developer, Python and C# were on the agenda. My prior knowledge of OOP and the other languages led me to learn the first frameworks.


I am currently working with Javascript, Django and Docker
